# Cyber Kill Chain Scenario
=================================

## Attacker: Megatron

### Stage 1: Reconnaissance

Megatron begins by gathering information about the target. This involves using various tools and techniques to identify potential entry points and gather intelligence. Successful reconnaissance allows Megatron to proceed to the next stage.

### Stage 2: Weaponization

After a successful reconnaissance, Megatron moves to the weaponization stage. In this stage, Megatron creates a malicious payload designed to exploit vulnerabilities discovered during reconnaissance. This payload will be used in the next stages to compromise the target system.

### Stage 2: Weaponization (Continued)

Megatron is crafting a "weapon of destruction." It doesn't want to interact with the victim directly, and is, instead, creating a "weaponizer" that will, according to Lockheed Martin, combine malware and exploit into a deliverable payload. The attacker chooses to buy an already written payload from someone on the DarkWeb, so that he (Megatron) can spend more time on other phases of the attack.

Megatron creates:
- **An infected MS Office document** containing malicious macro or VBA scripts.
- **A malicious payload or sophisticated worm**, which is implanted on USB drives and distributed in public.
- The attacker will choose the C2 (Command and Control) techniques for executing commands on the victim's machine or delivering more payloads.
- The attacker selects a backdoor implant.

### Next Steps

I will continue to document the progress and tactics used by Megatron as it moves through the stages of the Cyber Kill Chain.
